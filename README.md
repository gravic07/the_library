#The Library


This application was created as my submission for project 3 of Udacity's
Full Stack Nanodegree program.  The objective of project 3 is to develop a
web application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories
 and to integrate third party user registration and authentication.  I
 decided to make an application called The Library where users can create
 collections of books to share with their friends.


##Important Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **library.py** | This is the main Python file which uses the Flask framework to build a dynamic website. |
| **library_setup.py** | This Python file will create a PostgreSQL database at a specified location. |
| **boxOfBoxes.py** | A Python file that will populate the The Library with some test data. |
| **requirements.txt** | Lists all required dependencies for The Library. |
| **templates Folder** | Stores all HTML templates for the application. |
| **static Folder** | Stores all dependencies/resources for the HTML templates. |

####Installation Steps:
1. Open terminal:
  - Windows: Use the Git Bash program (installed with Git) to get a Unix-style terminal.
  - Other systems: Use your favorite terminal program.
2. Change to the desired parent directory
  - Example: `cd Desktop/`
3. Using Git, clone the VM configuration from Udacity:
  - Run: `git clone http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm fullstack`
  - This will create a new directory titled **fullstack** that contains all of the necessary configurations to run this application.
4. Move to the **vagrant** folder by executing: `cd fullstack/vagrant/`
5. Using Git, clone this project:
  - Run: `git clone https://github.com/gravic07/the_library.git the_library`
  - This will create a directory inside the *vagrant* directory titled *the_library*.
6. Run Vagrant by executing: `vagrant up`
7. SSH into Vagrant by executing: `vagrant ssh`
8. Move to the **the_library** directory by executing: `cd /vagrant/the_library/`
9. Create a local database be executing: `python library_setup.py`
  - This will create a PostgreSQL database within the **the_library** directory entitled **bookshelves.psql**
10. (Optional) Populate the database with some test information by executing: `python boxOfBoxes.py`
11. Deploy the app by executing: `python library.py`


## Usage
Once the installation steps are complete, you are ready to open the application.

1. Open a browser and enter the url **http://localhost:5000**.
  - If you run into issues at this point, ensure that nothing else is already using port 5000.
2. The application should now be running and fully functional
